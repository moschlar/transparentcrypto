transparentcrypto
=================

Advanced usability/visibility for PGP cryptography in Emails to support cryptography literacy.

This Thunderbird addon consists of two parts:
An *Email Encryption Live Preview* window while composing a message and a *Graph Visualization of your PGP Keyring*.


Setup
-----

The easiest way to setup this extension during the development phase is
to create a file called `transparentcrypto@secuso.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de`
in the `extensions` sub-directory of your Thunderbird profile folder,
e.g. `~/.thunderbird/jm9kbpgm.dev/extensions/` containing just the path to
the source code from this repository, e.g. `/home/moschlar/src/transparentcrypto`.
